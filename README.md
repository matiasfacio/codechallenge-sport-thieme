## Notes:

- As the seeding for the database didn't work at first, I created a form to add a new coach. After getting an answer from Tobias, this feature wasn't not necessary anymore, but kept it as it was already there.

## TODO:

- [x] Write graphql queries against https://localhost:3000/api<br>Use your queries manually or with the already installed codegen `yarn generate:types`.<br>You got one query in the graphql folder for free.
- [x] Create a UI to list all our coaches at Sport-Thieme with the Material-UI components (already installed)
- [x] Create a UI for a single coach with the Material-UI components (already installed)
- [x] Implement at least one mutation updating the coaches
- [x] Implement a mutation for adding specialties to the coach

### Bonus tasks for style points ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Implement pagination or endless scrolling to the coach list
- [x] Implement sorting to the coach list
- [x] Use Apollo reactive variables to create a local state to mark coaches as favourite

### Beyond bonus

- [x] Implement SSG or SSR
